    Construct a JSON reference resolver.

    The resolved specs are in the `specs` member after a call to
    `resolve_references` has been made.

    If a URL is given, it is used as a base for calculating the absolute
    URL of relative file references.

    :param dict specs: The parsed specs in which to resolve any references.
    :param str url: [optional] The URL to base relative references on.
    :param dict reference_cache: [optional] Reference cache to use. When
        encountering references, nested RefResolvers are created, and this
        parameter is used by the RefResolver hierarchy to create only one
        resolver per unique URL.
        If you wish to use this optimization across distinct RefResolver
        instances, pass a dict here for the RefResolvers you create
        yourself. It's safe to ignore this parameter in other cases.
    :param int recursion_limit: [optional] set the limit on recursive
        references. The default is 1, indicating that an element may be
        refered to exactly once when resolving references. When the limit
        is reached, the recursion_limit_handler is invoked.
    :param callable recursion_limit_handler: [optional] A callable that
        gets invoked when the recursion_limit is reached. Defaults to
        raising ResolutionError. Receives the recursion_limit as the
        first parameter, and the parsed reference URL as the second. As
        the last parameter, it receives a tuple of references that have
        been detected as recursions.
    :param str encoding: [optional] The encoding to use. If not given,
        detect_encoding is used to determine the encoding.
